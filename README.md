# Restaurante_APC

## Restaurant simulator in C, made in 2016/2 as the final project of APC.
- The restaurant is based on the available text file, made only with characters;
- The '0' character represents the customer or the set of clients; 
- When a table is occupied, the people occupying the table are represented by asterisks;
- There is a function in the program that causes people, after a certain real time, to start leaving the restaurant.
